## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

During the development of the app, several challenges arose. Handling and parsing the JSON data from games.js required careful attention to ensure accurate conversion and validation. Dynamically updating the DOM presented its own set of difficulties, particularly in clearing old content and appending new elements without disrupting the existing structure. Implementing effective filtering and sorting for funded and unfunded games was crucial for displaying the correct data, and presenting the top two games involved precise sorting and array destructuring. Additionally, managing edge cases, such as when there are fewer than two games or all games are unfunded, demanded extra checks to maintain robustness. Overall, these challenges provided valuable learning experiences in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
